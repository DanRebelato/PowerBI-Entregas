# 📊 Supplier Deliveries and Performance Report - Power BI

This project presents a Power BI dashboard summarizing material deliveries throughout the year, within a multinational telecommunications company.  
The data and names used have been modified but simulate a real performance management scenario from the period.

## 🧩 About the Project

The goal of this report is to provide a consolidated view of total deliveries, enabling monitoring by supplier.

## 🧩 About the Data

The Excel-based data used in this dashboard was generated through a full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, including:

- Raw data extraction via SAP, from different modules and operational reports;  
- Processing and merging with internal complementary spreadsheets using Excel;  
- Final consolidation into a single file, used as the base for modeling and visualization in Power BI.

Although intermediate and original files are not in this repository, the current structure faithfully simulates the logic and context of the original project.
